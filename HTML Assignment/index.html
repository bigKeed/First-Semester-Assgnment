          <h2 class="sID">My Biography</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Edwin. I was born in Jos,Plateau State on the 12th of
            March 2004. A year later after my birth my parents moved to
            Lafia,Nasarawa State where my siblings were also given birth to.I
            have two sibligs; A Male and a Female. Their names are Gift and love
            respectively. We all grew up in Lafia,I attended my Nursery,Primary
            and secondary school Education there. In 2020,The pandemic
            interupted my exams and delayed my entry into the university. But
            after the whole pandemic I got admission into PLateau State
            University to study A Bachelors Degree in Microbiology, which I'm
            currently still enrolled in the programme. While in schol, I got
            introduced into the Tech ecosystem by a friend and my love for the
            Tech ecosystem began to grow. A few months later Altschool's
            application opened for new aspiring developers which I wasted no
            time to get myself involed.

        <h2 class="sID">Why Did I join Altschool Africa?</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been a huge fan of the tech ecosystem and a great
          problem solver. I believe with Altschol anyone with great
          determination would be equipped with the necessary skills required to
          have a career in tech and create vast solutions to different realtime
          problems.
